### Project Planning
In this phase we started planning with our database models. We did research on the API that we would use which we knew would be important to our planning depending on the data that we received back from the API. After finding an API that we liked, we built out our models. Our models were simple because we only had one relation from our parent model (users) to our child model (drinks). We then moved on to our wireframing for our site. This would determine what components we would need and how we would build essential structure to our site. After we were able to work through these items, we then went on to coding.
### Project Coding
During this phase we started building our routes and a skeleton structure of our site. We were able to get routes working fairly quickly. We tested the routes by using Postman. The bare bones skeleton of the website was set and then we moved on to the logic of our website.
While working on this part of the project we had some slight hiccups with getting data to render but after some troubleshooting, we were able to get our data sending. Getting data to render from our own API was rather simple but saving data to our database provided some great learning opportunities. After we were able to overcome this slight hurdle, we worked on getting our code to become more dynamic to render individual drinks and user information. We then worked on styling to make sure that everything was presentable.
